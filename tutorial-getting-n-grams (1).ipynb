    "### The order words are used in is important\n",
    "\n",
    "The order that words are used in text is not random. In English, for example, you can say \"the red apple\" but not \"apple red the\". The relationships between words in text is very complex. So complex, in fact, that there's an entire field of linguistics devoted to it: syntax. (You can learn more about syntax [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ba33/a9656f43a6b7420a180bdeccd5be98fc05eb.pdf), if you're interested.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a relatively simply way of capturing some of these relationships between words, originally proposed by Warren Weaver. You can capture quite a bit of information by just looking at which words tend to show up next to each other more often. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are ngrams? \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is that you can look at each pair (or triple, set of four, etc.) of words that occur next to each other. In a sufficently-large corpus, you're likely to see \"the red\" and \"red apple\" several times, but less likely to see \"apple red\" and \"red the\". This is useful to know if, for example, you're trying to figure out what someone is more likely to say to help decide between possible output for an automatic speech recognition system.\n",
    "\n",
    "These co-occuring words are known as \"n-grams\", where \"n\" is a number saying how long a string of words you considered. (Unigrams are single words, bigrams are two words, trigrams are three words, 4-grams are four words, 5-grams are five words, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning goal:** In this tutorial, you'll learn how to find all the n-grams in a corpus & count how often each is used."
